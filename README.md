Netgen/NGSolve is a high-performance finite element library designed for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Developed in C++/C, it offers a streamlined Python interface for ease of use. 

The boundary element method (BEM) functionality has been integrated into NGSolve since August 2025, and this repository is intended as a supplement to the existing NGSolve tutorials and demos.

This repository presents a curated collection of notebooks that illustrate how NGSolve supports the implementation of boundary element methods (BEM). Within the notebooks, the breadth of current BEM capabilities is demonstrated, specifically showcasing the Python interface for solving boundary value problems related to the homogeneous Laplace, Helmholtz, and Maxwell equations as available in NGSolve.
