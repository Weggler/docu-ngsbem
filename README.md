This repository contains documentation on boundary element methods and connects these theoretical concepts with practical guidance for implementation in NGSolve.

The objective is to explain boundary element methods from a user perspective to interested readers and to provide and elucidate the necessary steps for efficient problem-solving.

In addition to comprehensive Jupyter demonstrations, overviews and summaries are also provided.
